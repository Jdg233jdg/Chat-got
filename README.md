This repository contains a Tampermonkey user script that scrapes webpages up to
three levels deep. The script provides an overlay interface to select content
types, a dynamic progress bar and export capabilities (txt, csv, pdf). It also
includes concurrency control, retry logic and a stop button to cancel the
scrape.
